     - name: Pacific Beach (and Mission Bay/Beach) 
       descr: this is where everyone 20/30-something who comes to San Diego seems to end up staying. Very beach vibe, good priced airbnbs and pretty walkable

       descr: Love North Park and surrounding areas for the community feel and walkability to cafes

     - name: Little Italy

     - name: Del Mar 
       descr: it’s walkable, it has my favorite beaches, and the food is great – like La Jolla, more hotels than airbnb

     - name: Coronado 
       descr: it’s an island, it’s pretty, it’s got a New England ish feel to it, but be careful! If you jaywalk you will get a ticket
